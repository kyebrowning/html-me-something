      <h3>I've been playing all types of games all my life, even to the point of creating a large gaming convention. Below is a short list of my favorite and top 5 board games.</h3>

        <li>Dominion</li>
        <li>Star Wars: X-Wing</li>

      <p>The below list is not listed in any ranking. I had a hard time trying to officially rank then but ultimately decided to list them in no particular order. If you are interested in learning more about the game or would like to purchase the game, I will include a link below each entry. However, its best to support your Friendly Local Game Store (FLGS), so find one in your area and support local business.</p>

      <h1>Dominion</h1>

      <p>I am a sucker for deck-building or engine card games, so it should come as no surprise that Dominion found its way on my top 5 list. Not only is it a basic deck-building game, it has a plethora of expansions making each game and strategy to win unique.</p>
      <p>So what is a deck-building game? It's typcially a card game, though sometimes a game board is invovled, where the main focus of the game is to build your deck of cards using game resources to acquire enough victory points to win the game.</p>
