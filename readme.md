Hi and welcome to my site that was created as an assignment for the LaunchCode cirriculum. 

https://kyebrowning.github.io/html-me-something/

I had to use basic HTML and CSS to develop a site of a topic of my choosing. 

I chose to put together a list of some of my favorite board games. 

Thanks for taking a stop by and checking out the site.
